Crypto Challenge Set 6

This is the last of our original crypto challenges.

This set exclusively covers number-theoretic cryptography, and, in particular, RSA and DSA.

This set is hard. The concepts are again new. The attacks involve some math --- but nothing you didn't learn in 9th grade --- and a significant amount of programming.

But they're worth it. Two of these attacks in particular are among the most valuable in real-world cryptography.
